"This small town used to be a somewhat successful mining community, exporting "
"rare earth materials and other resources to the rest of the solar system."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:67
msgid ""
"The mines have depleted recently, however. The town was under a threat of "
"bankruptcy. Living here became harder and many left to seek new "
"opportunities elsewhere."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:68
msgid ""
"But now after the Great Assault, the rest of the planet gets bombarded by "
"automated bot ships every now and then, so being here isn't so bad at all."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:69
msgid "Even with the Red Guard in charge."

msgid ""
"The shop is to the north, near the gate. Ms. Stone always has a good range "

"Of course, the Red Guard always has the biggest guns and the best armor, but "

"According to my calculations based on the Fermi estimate, there are about "
"seven million bots active in the region, everything from cleaner bots and "
"servant droids to much more dangerous ones."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:88
msgid ""
"I think you will agree with me that the following statement is true: If "
"bots, then death to everything alive."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:89
msgid "Now, I make the assumption that you and I are alive."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:90
msgid "But, if we are not dead, and if bots are killing everything alive..."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:91
msgid "... THEN WE HAVE A CONTRADICTION!"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:92
msgid "Calm down. There must be some logic behind this."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:93
msgid "There can be none!"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:94
msgid "They could just enter the town and massacre everyone..."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:95
msgid "But they do not even seem to try!"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:96
msgid "This makes no sense at all!"

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:104
msgid ""
"The phenomenon of hostile bots has occupied my mind for quite some time. "
"There are some strange irrationalities in this behavior, that I cannot "
"explain."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:105
msgid ""
"This encompasses not only the suddenness of the attack, but also the methods "
"and the scale of it all."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:113
msgid ""
"There are many. Each kind of bot has a number consisting of three digits. "
"The first one is the most significant, the class of a bot."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:114
msgid "I know a bit about three classes."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:115
msgid ""
"The 100s are cleaning bots of old. Therefore, they are quite common. "
"Fortunately for us they aren't as good at killing things as they are at "
"cleaning up the mess afterwards."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:116
msgid ""
"The 200s are servant bots, designed to come quickly when summoned and be "
"able to lift heavy weights. That makes them more dangerous under most "
"circumstances, so beware of being attacked by more than one at the same time."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:117
msgid ""
"Right now, an encounter with a 300 type bot equals death, so try to avoid "
"it. They were messenger bots before the Great Assault, which means they have "
"superb visual sensors, and some are very fast."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:118
msgid ""
"There are many more classes out there. The military used bots, of course, "
"and they were used on ships, but I know nothing about those types."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:128
msgid "We all do, Linarian, we all do."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:129
msgid ""
"The act in question is made impossible by the quasi-infinite bots outside of "
"the town walls."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:130
msgid "You cannot live for long out there."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:138
msgid ""
"Simple. Walk outside the town walls, and the bots will send you to the other "
"world within a few minutes."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:139
msgid "Unless you mean leave the planet, in which case that is impossible."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:140
msgid ""
"Most likely all of our cosmodromes have been destroyed in the bot attacks."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:148
msgid "There are many things you can do. The first is to fight more bots."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:149
msgid ""
"Er... Wouldn't that cause me to be beaten up more, and therefore be counter-"
"productive?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:150
msgid ""
"Your logic is infallible, Linarian, but you are forgetting one thing: the "
"more you fight, the more experienced you become, and the better you become "
"at surviving."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:151
msgid ""
"Also, if you have the money and can find a supplier, it is wise to invest in "
"better equipment - more protective clothing and better weaponry."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:152
msgid ""
"My advice is to invest in a ranged weapon. While it can create a huge hole "
"in your wallet, it also creates several in the bots, and is better than a "
"huge hole in you."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:153
msgid ""
"Currently there is a ban on selling such things. The Red Guard wants to be "
"the only ones with good weapons."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:154
msgid ""
"Should you fail to find something decent to shoot or swing with, there are "
"always other options."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:155
msgid ""
"Ewald, the barkeeper, usually sells an assortment of junk, but even he "
"sometimes has something worthwhile on display."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:156
msgid ""
"There was a person selling grenades, too. Eh... I forgot his name, my memory "
"is not serving me very well today. He's a very mysterious fellow. Perhaps he "
"can help you."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:157
msgid "Other than that, you are on your own."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:166
msgid ""
"The Red Guard...? Only if you're as strong and courageous as they are! There "
"is no one better than the Red Guard! Nothing but top quality men there!"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:168
msgid ""
"The Red Guard? Unlikely. You'd have to establish a reputation beforehand, "
"and demonstrate that you can make things happen."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:169
msgid ""
"Also, the Red Guard is not a very popular organization, so if you do join "
"them then you can expect to be hated by nearly everyone here."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:170
msgid ""
"As the ancients said, 'Boni pastoris est tondere pecus, non deglubere'. A "
"good tax must be a reasonable tax."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:181
msgid ""
"I know of two types, the 123 and the 139. The former is a simple cleaning "
"bot, and is fairly weak. The latter is a mobile trash compactor. Don't get "
"your flippers get caught in one of those."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:182
msgid "I've seen some of those on my way here. They were... Shooting at me."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:183
msgid "Many strange things have happened since the Great Assault."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:184
msgid ""
"Anyway, because the class 100 bots are neither fast nor dangerous, the Red "
"Guard often uses them for target practice."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:185
msgid "If I were you, I would not overestimate them."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:186
msgid "Nec Hercules contra plures."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:196
msgid ""
"In fitting with the lazy nature of humans, there are several servant bots of "
"the 200 class."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:197
msgid ""
"The 247 is often called the 'Banshee'. Being a simple servant robot, it "
"isn't very well equipped to kill, although its arms are quite strong."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:198
msgid ""
"Also, as I said, the 200s were built to report quickly. The 247 is no "
"exception, and moves faster than some of us can run. As a killer bot, it has "
"a fast rate of attack. It is not something to be trifled with."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:199
msgid ""
"The 249 is a cheaper version of the Banshee. It uses a tripedal drive "
"instead of anti-gravity propulsion, and is therefore slower. However it is "
"much more dangerous: its machine gun has a very high rate of fire."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:200
msgid "Machine gun?! But... But it's a servant bot!"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:202
msgid "I know, %s. I know."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:203
msgid ""
"Let's see... Oh, there is also the 296, which was used for serving drinks. "
"Ewald once had one of those in his bar."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:204
msgid "Once? What happened to it?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:205
msgid ""
"No one knows. One day it simply wasn't there. Ewald probably remembers more "
"than I do, though."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:215
msgid ""
"Though I do not know the details, I assure you there are many. Robots and "
"automated machinery served almost every purpose you can imagine, and "
"probably some that you can't."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:216
msgid ""
"They were used by the military, aboard ships, as security droids and more. "
"Right now, however, most of the people who knew them up close are pushing up "
"daisies."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:225
msgid "I guess you mean in the universe?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:226
msgid "Yes, I think that is your name for it."

"Well, we are in a barred spiral galaxy, twenty-six thousand light years away "
"from the galactic core."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:228

"The galactic radius is 43,000 light years and the circumference is estimated "

"This is a planetary system of ten planets, and we are presently located on "
"the third one from our star, Sol."
msgstr ""

"I am not an astronomer, so I could be wrong. I am too tired to keep track of "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:231
msgid "This could be just about anywhere. Your description is too ambiguous."
msgstr ""

msgid "...Right."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:241
msgid "Oh did he? What exactly did he say about me?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:242
msgid "He said you might know more about who I am, about Linarians."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:243
msgid ""
"Hmmm... I'm not so sure about 'who', but he is quite right about my "
"knowledge of Linarians... quite right indeed. What would you like to know, "

"Since you are asking this question and you have even come into our town, I "

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:318
msgid "What happened to the other Linarians that survived first contact?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:319
msgid ""
"Sadly, I do not know. All that remains are legends. For a time, Linarians "
"wandered the planet performing grand deeds and earning the respect of most "
"of humanity."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:320
msgid ""
"But as time passed, so did the memories of the great deeds. It is unlikely "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:321 dialogs/Chandra.lua:338
msgid ""
"Perhaps there are still other Linarians alive here on our planet. Or maybe "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:333
msgid "Your people slaughtered us?!"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:334
msgid ""
"Yes, this is the truth and it is something most humans regret. It is this "
"regret that has helped erase the Linarians from our history."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:335
msgid ""
"Humanity does not have a pretty history. We have done many horrible things "
"to each other as well. There are many things we regret so deeply that we "
"wish we could forget."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:336
msgid ""
"Over time, most people have willingly forgotten our actions and focused on "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:337
msgid ""
"Even though we tried to celebrate the grand deeds and heroics of the "
"surviving Linarians, the memories faded. The memories turned into legends "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:339
msgid ""
"Spencer and the Red Guard would not want you to know these things, as you "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:378
msgid ""
"While you will find some people helpful because of this, others may be a bit "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Chandra.lua:380
msgid ""
"Don't tell anyone else, but I'm surprised the Red Guard ordered you to be "
