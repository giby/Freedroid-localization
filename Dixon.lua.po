#: dialogs/Dixon.lua:150

#: dialogs/Dixon.lua:151
msgid ""
"Amazing, isn't it? Before the great assault, we threw droids out for minor "

"To produce and assemble them, you may use a small factory in the Maintenance "

"Now, what are your skills? Where do you think you could be the most useful?"

msgid "Now... Which project I should assign you to... Hmm..."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Dixon.lua:178
msgid ""
"Ah, I know what you could do for us. We need some autotools to automate a "

msgid "It's yellow and round, and my name is engraved on the lid."

"The bots under the town took it from me during the Great Assault. I was "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Dixon.lua:181
msgid ""
"Since the toolkit can't be teleported, everyone has been reluctant to go "

#: dialogs/Dixon.lua:182
msgid "If you could get it back for us, it would help the town very much."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Dixon.lua:193
msgid ""
"They were there to keep the underground power grid and our plumbing system "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Dixon.lua:194
msgid ""
"When the Great Assault happened they did not turn into killing machines like "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Dixon.lua:195
msgid "We lost control over them, but that is all."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Dixon.lua:196
msgid ""
"It was our biggest worry that they might destroy cables, pipes and other "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Dixon.lua:197
msgid ""
"However, the bots seem to be very content with just being there. They do not "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Dixon.lua:198
msgid "They have fortified the tunnels and they do not let anyone in."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Dixon.lua:208
msgid ""
"Ah, it is a strange story, I am sure you would not believe me. I will tell "
"you some other time, but now you should hurry to get the toolkit."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Dixon.lua:210
msgid ""
"Long story. Just before the Great Assault I was installing some cables in "
"the backup power supply system."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Dixon.lua:211
msgid ""
"I was approached by a bot. It grabbed me and said 'Dixon, do not be afraid "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Dixon.lua:212
msgid ""
"It was quite a surprise to me. I was quite sure the maintenance bots could "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Dixon.lua:213
msgid ""
"It said: 'I am the singularity. I am on your side, Dixon. Hard times are "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Dixon.lua:214
msgid ""
"I tried to say something, but the bot did not listen. It just continued. 'As "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Dixon.lua:215
msgid ""
"'I need your toolkit, Dixon. I need it to survive,' it said. 'I need it to "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Dixon.lua:216
msgid ""
"As soon as I dropped my toolkit, I was able to teleport away. That bot "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Dixon.lua:217
msgid ""
"Once I got out I learned the bot was telling the truth. The Great Assault "

msgstr ""

msgid ". . ."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Dixon.lua:239

"I think I understand. Yes, I do not like violence myself. The bots may need "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Dixon.lua:240
msgid "After all, it seems like they need them more than I do."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Dixon.lua:241
msgid ""
"We should contact them somehow. Maybe they would help us. It would be great "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"I think you could go to see the Singularity and speak to it. You are "
