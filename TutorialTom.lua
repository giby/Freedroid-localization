"Perhaps the best thing you can find, though, is armor. At least, given the "

msgid ""
"In the years since you entered stasis, mankind has done much research in the "
"field of robotics."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:356
msgid ""
"One branch in particular that has served us well is the realm of "
"nanotechnology."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:357
msgid ""
"Because they run a very simple operating system, nanobots were not affected "
"by whatever caused the Great Assault."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:358
msgid ""
"To this day, our armor and clothing are made out of nanobots. This enables "
"many different sizes of people to wear the same clothing."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:359
msgid ""
"The nanobots reshape the garment for a comfortable fit, so even you should "
"be able to wear them without problem."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:368

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:371
msgid ""
"Even the best of fighters sometimes get hit by enemy blows. If I were you, I "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:372
msgid ""
"They will help to mitigate some of the damage you take from melee or ranged "
"combat."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:373
msgid ""
"Keep in mind, though, that there is a chance that your armor will take "
"damage whenever you get hit. Keep an eye on it, or you'll lose it."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:381
msgid ""
"Well, let me start by saying that there are four classes of armor: headgear, "
"shoes, body armor, and shields."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:382
msgid ""
"When you pick up a piece of armor of a particular class, and you don't "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:383
msgid ""
"Picking up armor and items can be accomplished by [b]left clicking[/b] on "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:384
msgid ""
"If you currently have one piece of armor equipped that you would like to "
"swap out for another, simply drag the new armor piece to the current armor "
"piece and left click."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:385
msgid ""
"They will swap places, and you can put the other piece of armor back into "
"your inventory."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:386
msgid ""
"Alternatively, you can drag it into your field of view and drop it on the "
"ground."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:394
msgid "Well, there are several ways to keep that from happening."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:395
msgid ""
"Equipped items in poor condition will show up yellow and should turn red if "
"in critical condition."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:396
msgid ""
"If you don't unequip an item in poor or critical condition it may be ruined!"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:397
msgid ""
"There are three things you can do when an item reaches critical condition:"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:398
msgid "First, you can sell or discard the item."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:399
msgid ""
"Second, you can use your [b]repair equipment[/b] program on the item, which "
"will repair the item at the cost of some of its durability."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:400
msgid ""
"Or third, you can have the item repaired at a shop, which maintains the "
"item's durability at a price."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:408
msgid "Well, I can think of a few reasons."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:409
msgid ""
"You might not have enough room in your inventory for an item you need more, "
"or can sell for more."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:410
msgid ""
"If an item is close to being destroyed, you might also consider dropping it."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:411
msgid ""
"And finally some items give negative status effects, and aren't worth "
"selling."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:412
msgid "Armor or weapons may affect you in different ways."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:413
msgid ""
"Some will help you out, for example by increasing your cooling rate or "
"increasing your dexterity. This is the work of specialized nanobots, but the "
"reverse can happen too."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:425
msgid "Perhaps I should start by explaining programs in general."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:426
msgid ""
"To use a program, select it through your HUD (remember the [b]s key[/b] "
"toggles your [b]Skills/Program menu[/b])."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:427
msgid ""
"After you've selected a program, run the program by right clicking. "
"Depending on the program you can target an enemy, an item, or just the world."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:428
msgid ""
"You can also assign quick-select keys to programs. Simply hover over the "
"program in the Skills/Program menu and press one of the keys [b]F5[/b] to "
"[b]F12[/b]. Then, whenever you press this button, you will select the "
"corresponding program."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:429
msgid ""
"If you're curious what a program does, you can find out by clicking the "
"question mark in the Skills/Program menu."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:430
msgid ""
"Now, to answer your question, you use your repair equipment program by "
"selecting it in the Skills/Program menu, then right clicking on the item you "
"wish to repair."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:445
msgid ""
"Ok, I'll open the next door then. But prepare yourself, soon you will learn "
"how to fight against bots in hand-to-hand combat."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:458
msgid "I will certainly try my best."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:459
msgid ""
"It's odd to think that a flightless bird would be such a scrapper, but you "
"Linarians have been surprising us since the beginning."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:460
msgid ""
"We prefer to fight the blamed droids at a distance. They're less likely to "
"rend us limb from limb that way."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:461
msgid ""
"Unfortunately, guns and other ranged weaponry are hard to come by these days."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:462
msgid ""
"That goes double for ammunition. Because these are bots, you really can't "
"effectively keep them at bay by just waving around an empty gun."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:463
msgid ""
"With that in mind, your most reliable weapons are your fists. They never run "
"out of ammo or wear down, but of course they don't do much damage against a "
"metal body, either."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:471
msgid "There may be times when you have no choice."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:472
msgid ""
"Melee combat, armed or unarmed, can be initiated by [b]left clicking[/b] on "
"an enemy."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:473
msgid "You will then walk over to the enemy and start hitting them."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:474
msgid ""
"Now, I understand you may have some concerns over your safety during this..."
msgstr ""

msgid "Never mind, just an old song."

"Fighting the bots hand-to-hand has risks, there is no question. However, "
"there are things you can do to even the odds."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:480
msgid ""
"We already discussed armor. Another useful type of item is medical supplies."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:481
msgid ""
"There are a few different types of restorative items. The most common are "
"health drinks."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:489
msgid ""
"Man has practiced medicine in one form or another for hundreds of years."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:490

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:491
msgid ""
"There are many kinds, but all accomplish the same thing, to varying degrees."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:492
msgid ""
"Certain items, like health drinks, can be used directly without clicking on "
"them."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:493
msgid ""
"At the bottom of your HUD, you'll notice your item access belt. Small items "

msgstr ""

"Unlike armor or weapons, multiple of these items will group together in your "

msgid ""
"If you have Diet Supplements equipped in item slot 1, you can press 1 to use "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:537
msgid "So you have. Well done."

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:538
msgid "I'll exchange this wrench for it. I think you'll find it handy."
msgstr ""

msgstr ""

"Certain parts in the bots are extra valuable. You can sell them at stores "

msgid ""
"There are several traditional weapons in the world such as swords or light "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/TutorialTom.lua:564

"For example, that wrench I just gave you will increase the damage you do, "
