msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Tamara.lua:99
msgid "Well, it's understandable. We are sisters."

"So a holy rabbi shaped a Golem out of clay, and brought it to life through "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Tamara.lua:206
msgid ""
"The Golem initially protected the Jews, but was brainless and stupid, and so "

msgid ""
"It was only by trickery that the rabbi was able to even get close to the "
"Golem."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Tamara.lua:208
msgid ""
"But as the rabbi changed 'emet' to 'met' (death), the Golem fell on him, and "
"both the creator and creation became lifeless."

#: dialogs/Tamara.lua:238
