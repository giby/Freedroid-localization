msgid "Hello."

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:31
msgid "Well, hello again."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:42
msgid ""
"Ah, so you are the new member. Welcome. My name is Benjamin, and I take care "
"of our ranged weaponry here in the citadel."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:43
msgid "Benjamin - Gunsmith"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:51
msgid ""
"I'm experimenting with new designs. I want to redesign the laser pistol."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:52
msgid ""
"A lot of energy is wasted somewhere during firing, and I have no idea where. "
"If I could find the source of the problem, the gun would become much more "
"powerful."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:53
msgid ""
"So far all my prototypes have failed. Mostly overheating and jamming. "
"Sometimes I wonder if I am doing something wrong."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:61
msgid "Hmm... There might be something in that idea. I will think about it."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:69
msgid "Hmm... I will think about it. Hmm..."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:77
msgid "Yeah, maybe you are right. I will think about it."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:86
msgid ""
"If anyone in this town knows more about guns than me, then my name's not "
"Benjamin."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:87
msgid ""
"Of course, I will need compensation for the ammunition spent in the training "
"and for my time."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:88
msgid "Say... A hundred circuits should be enough for a beginner lesson."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:89 dialogs/Benjamin.lua:95 dialogs/Benjamin.lua:100
#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:105 dialogs/Benjamin.lua:110
msgid "Interested?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:92
msgid "Oh, you are ready for some more training?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:93
msgid ""
"It will of course cost a bit more money as well as mental focus on your part."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:94
msgid ""
"It will take you two hundred circuits and double the effort on your part to "
"become a true apprentice."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:98
msgid "I see you have taken a liking to guns."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:99
msgid ""
"But the next step will cost even more money and require the mental focus "
"equaling all your previous training."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:103
msgid "Oh, you want to become a real master with shooters?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:104
msgid ""
"It will cost you 400 valuable circuits and an awful lot of mental focusing "
"on the task."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:108
msgid ""
"To become a true god of firearms, just like me, you need ridiculous amounts "
"of training."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:109
msgid ""
"It will of course cost a fair bit of cold, hard circuits as well. 500, to be "
"precise."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:113
msgid "Sorry, there is no human alive that could give you further training."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:123
msgid "Yes, I'd like some basic training in ranged combat."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:126
msgid "Suits me well enough, I'm not busy at the moment anyway."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:127
msgid ""
"Now, the most important thing is that you turn off the auto-aim on your "
"weapon, like this."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:128
msgid ""
"Otherwise your weapon might 'help' you and shoot somewhere you didn't intend "
"to fire."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:129
msgid "The next important thing is to remember how to properly fire a shot."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:130
msgid ""
"Watch your target closely. Pretend you're moving with it. Aim for the head."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:131
msgid ""
"When you feel completely in sync with your target, then you pull the trigger."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:132
msgid "Good. You are learning fast. Try it a few more times."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:133
msgid "Okay, I think that it is enough for today."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:145
msgid "So lets start the second course?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:148
msgid "Very well."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:149
msgid "You must remain calm whilst shooting."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:150
msgid ""
"Try breathing out as you pull the trigger, and squeeze it gently rather than "
"jerking it."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:151
msgid ""
"That's right. You will find yourself hitting the target much more often now."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:163
msgid "So can you help me become even better with guns?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:166
msgid "Of course."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:167
msgid "Next lesson: hitting a moving target."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:168
msgid ""
"It's pretty simple really, just watch to see where it is going and then aim "
"slightly ahead if you are using a non-laser gun."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:169
msgid ""
"It's easy when you know how, especially with bots, because they tend to move "
"in straight lines, not bob and weave like people."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:170
msgid "I think that is enough training for now. Next time, firing on the move!"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:182
msgid "I'd like to learn how to be a crack shot."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:185
msgid ""
"Firing on the move is difficult, but can make survival much more likely!"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:186
msgid ""
"The secret is to keep your weapon steadily but loosely, so that it isn't "
"jarred."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:187
msgid ""
"Oh yes, and be careful of your footing. You should be looking where you are "
"firing, not where you are stepping."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:188
msgid "Keep practicing and you will get the hang of it eventually."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:200
msgid "Teach me how to be at one with my weapon."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:203
msgid ""
"The ultimate secret to becoming a god in ranged combat is something you "
"should value."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:204
msgid "I don't tell everyone this, so keep it to yourself, alright?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:205
msgid "To become a god in ranged combat you need to..."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:206
msgid "...practice. A lot."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:207
msgid "Go ahead and use my firing range as much as you need."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:219
msgid "You need more circuits."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:233
msgid "You are not ready. Go kill some bots and come back."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:247
msgid ""
"Well, for novice members there are simple laser and plasma pistols. They "
"have their share of problems, but they do the trick nine times out of ten."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:248
msgid ""
"For bigger bots we have bigger guns. The exterminator is the best weapon "
"that we have. We hand them out only in case of an emergency, or to highly "
"experienced people."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:256
msgid "It is!"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:257
msgid ""
"While many people find the ammunition canisters too big, and the bullets too "
"slow, they cannot deny that once plasma hits, it leaves big holes."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:258
msgid ""
"Plasma is matter, ionized gas to be exact. It also happens to be hot enough "
"to make steel boil."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:259
msgid ""
"Most of the new recruits hate how hard this weapon is to aim. If bullets "
"were animals, then plasma would be a well fed cow. By the time it arrives at "
"the target, the bot is already a mile away."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:260
msgid ""
"If you are going to use plasma weapons you need to remember one thing: Don't "
"let the weapon get damaged."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:261
msgid ""
"Even though our armor is designed to resist high temperatures, once the "
"plasma containment module goes, you will die, along with anything within ten "
"meters of you."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:262
msgid ""
"Because of all those drawbacks, plasma weapons are not too popular. Quite a "
"pity, they have great potential."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:270
msgid ""
"Laser is an acronym for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of "
"Radiation."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:271
msgid ""
"Laser is the technology employed in most of our weaponry. It uses a focused "
"light beam to cause damage."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:272
msgid ""
"Because the beam is composed out of light, it travels REALLY fast, at the "
"speed of light, so to say. Also it is not affected by gravity or wind, which "
"makes aiming easier."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:273
msgid ""
"However, other than being a good training tool for newbies, that design just "
"fails to deliver."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:274
msgid ""
"The shots tend to be underpowered, the gun takes a long while to power up "
"for a shot, and it can overheat during intense combat."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:275
msgid ""
"This is why I am trying to improve it, but so far I have had no success. I'm "
"feeling pretty discouraged about it."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:283
msgid ""
"Sorry, but that is classified and confidential. I have said too much already."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:291
msgid "Intriguing."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:292
msgid "Fifty circuits per bit of information."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:293
msgid "So... What do you exactly want to know?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:302
msgid ""
"It might come as a surprise to you, but we don't have many. A little over "
"twenty, last time I checked."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:303
msgid ""
"Thankfully, as you can clearly see, it's more than enough to keep all of the "
"cursed bots away."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:314
msgid ""
"Linarian, I thought we had an agreement. Fifty per infobit. My silence can "
"be only broken with currency, so if you want to know, you have to pay."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:315
msgid "This conversation is now over."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:324
msgid "They were a very lucky find."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:325
msgid ""
"We found a crashed army truck on the Terminal Field. It had six crates "
"inside it, each containing five exterminators."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:326
msgid "We tried, but we could not replicate the technology, only bullets."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:327
msgid ""
"A few got damaged in battle, and we failed to recover five after a failed "
"scout mission. We have twenty-two right now."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:339
msgid ""
"We use radioactive isotopes, whatever type happens to be on hand. Mostly "
"plutonium and uranium, but we are not too picky."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:340
msgid ""
"When we get low on ammo, we send in a chain gang of criminals and sluggards "
"into mine shaft K-17."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:341
msgid ""
"That place was closed down ages ago because of high radiation levels, but "
"it's full of good ore from which we make bullets and power our nuclear "
"reactors."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:342
msgid ""
"We get our fission materials, and they serve their sentence. It was one of "
"the best ideas we have ever had."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:353
msgid "That answer is on the house. Heh."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:354
msgid "We do not know, Linarian. We have absolutely no clue."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:362
msgid "Ugh. That will cost you triple."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:363
msgid "No. Wait."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:364
msgid "I changed my mind."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:365
msgid ""
"Keep your money Linarian. No amount of circuits can make me talk about that "
"accursed day."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:374
msgid ""
"That's a tricky question. Most of the force comes from the miniature nuclear "
"explosions which happen once the bullet hits something."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:375
msgid ""
"Of course, the high velocity of the impact can cause tremendous devastation "
"by itself."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:376
msgid ""
"We never bothered with doing much research on that topic. It works, and that "
"is enough for us."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:387
msgid "Very well. Oh... This conversation never happened."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Benjamin.lua:395
msgid "See you later!"
msgstr ""
