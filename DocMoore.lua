#: dialogs/DocMoore.lua:125

"Those pills are only one variant of a fantastic scientific breakthrough that "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/DocMoore.lua:316
msgid ""
"Three kinds of enhancement pills were developed. One for strength, one for "

msgid ""
"These pills work on a nanotechnological basis with small machines connecting "

msgid ""
"The machines connect together and form some inorganic artificial tissue that "
"has been optimized for certain qualities."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/DocMoore.lua:319
msgid ""
"Since this invention only came about shortly before the Great Assault, these "
"pills are now very rare."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/DocMoore.lua:320
msgid ""
"But if you should get them, even better, because the effects are permanent, "
"and as far as we can tell, there aren't any side effects!"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/DocMoore.lua:329
msgid "I already warned you about those!"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/DocMoore.lua:331
msgid ""
"Those pills are almost pure biological waste! They are sold to stupid "

msgid ""
"Have you tasted the army snacks that the cook, Michelangelo, has been "
"handing out?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/DocMoore.lua:341
msgid "Yes, those were horrible. They had a nice color though."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/DocMoore.lua:342
msgid "The dye used to make that color is a known carcinogen."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/DocMoore.lua:344
msgid "No, should I?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/DocMoore.lua:345
msgid "Not if you can avoid it."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/DocMoore.lua:347
msgid ""
"Well, unlike the army snacks, the Diet Supplements actually have a slight "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/DocMoore.lua:348
msgid "After taking one your health should improve slightly."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/DocMoore.lua:356
msgid "Basically it is bottled up poison made by bacteria."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/DocMoore.lua:357
msgid "And that is good for me?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/DocMoore.lua:358
msgid ""
"Yep. It kills the bacteria that want to kill you. It improves your health "
"significantly."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/DocMoore.lua:366
msgid ""
"It is a device that releases millions of short-lived nanobots that swarm all "
"over your body inside and out repairing and fixing almost all but the most "
"serious wounds."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/DocMoore.lua:367
msgid "Wouldn't long-lived nanobots work better?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/DocMoore.lua:368
msgid ""
"They found that long-lived nanobots evolve self-replication and act like a "
"cancer. A cancer of gray goo that eats everything."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/DocMoore.lua:369
msgid ""
"Several planets were made uninhabitable before they figured that one out."
