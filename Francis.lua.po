"Stasis is not too kind on the mind. It is not uncommon for strange dreams "

msgid "Wow, this is the worst case of cryo-neural damage I have ever seen."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:184
msgid ""
"The Red Guard had me thaw you out because you are a Linarian. I don't know "

"Look in the chest in the next room for some spare gear I managed to gather "

"Currently, there is a war raging all around the globe. One day, our once "
"loyal bots rebelled against us and began trying to wipe us out. The "
"beginning of this war has been dubbed 'The Great Assault.'"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:199
msgid ""
"And it looks like humans are losing the war. Our town isn't doing so well at "
"this point either. But there is still hope, since you were discovered here."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:207
msgid ""
"Unfortunately, I'm not the best source of information for that. All I know "
"is that one day the bots went crazy. Maybe someone else in town knows more."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:215
msgid ""
"I'm sorry, but you probably need to start traveling to the town. The Red "
"Guard are not known to be the most patient."

"They were the ones who wanted me to thaw you out, after all. You'd better "

msgid "It is a small mining community of perhaps 500 inhabitants..."

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:226
msgid ""
"I guess it was a stroke of luck that the town has not been completely "
"destroyed by the bots."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:227
msgid ""
"Oddly enough, the rusty old bots that the town uses for security were not "
"affected by whatever caused the other bots to go crazy."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:228
msgid ""
"Right now the town is 'protected' by the Red Guard, a bunch of opportunistic "
"roughnecks. It's not exactly a secret that I don't agree with their methods."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:229
msgid ""
"However, I must admit that being oppressed is a much better alternative to "
"being eviscerated alive."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:237
msgid ""
"Sure. You just need to follow the road outside to the east. After the "
"bridge, turn right and continue to follow the road and you will soon be "
"outside of the town main gate."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:238
msgid ""
"If you run across too many bots, you can try to circle around them. But "
"avoid getting too far off the road, so you don't get lost. It's very "
"dangerous out there."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:239
msgid ""
"Once in town you will be able to purchase or trade a few more items for "
"protection at Ms. Stone's shop just inside the town gate."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:247
msgid ""
"Oh, just take the small door and corridor out to the waiting room. And from "
"there you can get out through the customer entrance."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:248
msgid ""
"I keep the back entrance, close to my sleeping quarters, locked at all "
"times. Better safe than sorry."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:257
msgid ""
"Oh. You'll need to put the cryonic terminals into admin mode to access the "
"gate controls."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:258
msgid "How do I do that?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:259
msgid ""
"You press star-pound-zero-six-pound and then enter the free-speech number."

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:260
msgid "It is kind of long, so I'll write it down for you."

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:261
msgid ""
"If the 614 bot locks the gate, it is for a good reason. Lock the gate behind "
"you!"

"I am glad I could help you. You should be careful around here. Best head "

"Oh, I almost forgot... Could you take this data cube and give it to Spencer "
"once you get to town?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:271
msgid "Spencer?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:272
msgid "Yes. He's the leader of the Red Guard."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:282
msgid ""
"It's almost nothing... nothing important... if I know nothing about purposes."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:283
msgid ""
"Spencer wanted me to list all people in cryonic stasis. We had an argument "
"about it, but in the end I gave in. Maybe it's needed. I couldn't avoid it."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:284
msgid ""
"I'm not a bad person, but I don't like these types of decisions. Lose-lose "
"decisions are especially difficult. But, I suppose, it's like that for "
"everybody."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:285
msgid ""
"Bring your questions to Spencer. I'd rather not discuss it anymore, it is "
"too troubling, especially since I'm complicit in whatever happens."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:294
msgid "Thank you."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:295
msgid ""
"You can ask one of the guards in town, they'll know where to find Spencer."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:308
msgid ""
"Oh, I would, believe me. I'm quite capable of running my own errands, even "
"with the mass of bots out there."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:309
msgid ""
"But... The prospect of facing that... That man again... I just can't bear it."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:310
msgid "Please, %s, will you do me this favor?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:321
msgid "... All right."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:322
msgid "I can't force you to do it if you don't want to."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:323
msgid "I suppose I'll just have to go to Spencer myself."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:324
msgid ""
"Anyway, I am glad I could help you. You should be careful around here. Best "
"head straight for our town."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Francis.lua:335
msgid ""
"Oh... I almost forgot... This is a small help but I hope it will make your "
"life a little easier."

msgid ""
"Remember not to veer too far off the path, or your quest could be over "
