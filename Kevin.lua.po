msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:75
msgid "Hmm, strange things are happening to my lawnmower."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:76
msgid "But I don't have the time right now to take a look at it."

"I haven't eaten and slept very much in the last time so I'm a little hungry "

msgid ""
"That's great. You can't miss it. It's not hard to find. Enter my garden and "
"find the lower station entrance there."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:102
msgid ""
"It would be best not to bother with the resistance on the first level. You "
"only need to take care of the energy supply. And that's on the SECOND level."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:103
msgid ""
"I hope you have a laser pistol or something like that, the bots there will "

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:104
msgid ""
"Best make it quick. I'm already sick of stabilizing the stupid power grid."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:113
msgid "Too bad. Now get out of my sight."

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:122
msgid ""
"I've already received the results from the evaluation of my data in the "
"cluster. Good work."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:124
msgid ""
"Yes, since the energy supply has been constant, results were much better. "
"I've achieved my goal."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:125
msgid ""
"I've obtained secret data on the town surroundings. We'll need a big "
"computer cluster to evaluate it properly."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:126
msgid ""
"Once we've evaluated the data, we might find a way to secure the town and "
"ensure our survival. But it's too early to tell yet."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:127
msgid ""
"If I only had a suitable cluster. Then we could start data evaluation right "
"away."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:138
msgid ""
"You've already agreed to take my data cube to the cluster. I have no "
"influence on this matter anymore."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:139
msgid ""
"The fate of the town now rests in your hands. Take the data cube I gave you "
"to the cluster. Only there can the data be evaluated properly."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:141
msgid ""
"That would be great of course. I know that the old town is maintaining a "
"suitable information infrastructure and has had a proper cluster running for "
"some time now."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:142
msgid ""
"The only problem is, I can't go back to town. They would probably kill me "
"because of... a misunderstanding."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:143
msgid ""
"Also, the cluster is inside of the guard citadel. I hear that only members "
"of the Red Guard are allowed to enter the complex."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:144
msgid ""
"But maybe you can arrange that somehow. For me it would be impossible, "
"because of my reputation."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:145
msgid ""
"I'll give you the data cube. Take it to the computer cluster administration "
"people. They will know what to do. And don't mention me there."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:146
msgid "A kingdom for a cluster!"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:158
msgid "I've already rewarded you for that. Don't steal my time. I'm busy."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:161
msgid "What do you want?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:173
msgid ""
"Your desire for information amuses me. Your wish will be granted. I will "
"teach you how to improve your skill in designing hacking programs."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:174
msgid ""
"You must know that hacking is an art. It is easy to chop your enemy to bits "
"with an axe or shred it to atoms with a grenade... But hacking requires "
"skill."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:175
msgid ""
"Look at this terminal... I am connected to a remote system. A fool would "
"just launch a thousand attacks, but a skilled intruder stops and thinks."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:176
msgid ""
"You must know when to hack and when not to hack. You must attack when the "
"enemy is unprepared for you."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:177
msgid ""
"Now watch. Observe carefully. See how I enter the system... Yes. Watch the "
"connection glowing, burning like a bright star..."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:178
msgid ""
"...only to die seconds after, as the system far away collapses under it's "
"own weight... It's done."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:179
msgid ""
"That is all I want to show you for now. Maybe later I will teach you "
"something else."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:189
msgid ""
"Of course you can have that. There, I'm most grateful to you. That should do."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:199
msgid "Eh... Here, take these 900 circuits. That should be enough."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:209
msgid ""
"So be it. As reward for your help I grant you the right to think about that."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:210
msgid "Just joking. Come back when you've decided what you want."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:230
msgid "Oh. Right."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:231
msgid "Well, thanks for telling me."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:232
msgid "Back to the drawing board, I guess..."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:241
msgid "Why? I have backups from last %s. No reason to worry at all."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:242
msgid "Monday"

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:243
msgid "It will be a while till I get her together again, but she will be fine."

"I've got an important research project going on. In fact this project might "
"be crucial to the survival of the whole town."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:255
msgid ""
"There is tremendous importance in it. But the project is in danger. There "
"are some maintenance bots down at the energy source."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:256
msgid ""
"They are trying to 'maintain' machines by rebooting them all the time. This "
"must stop, but I can't leave this place."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:257
msgid ""
"I must balance the remaining power in such a way that my project can "
"continue uninterrupted."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:258
msgid ""
"Now, if you go down there and make the power flow stable, then I'll find the "
"time to teach you something."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:262
msgid ""
"As I've told you, I cannot teach you anything right now. I don't have the "
"time."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:263
msgid ""
"I must see that the flaky energy stream is distributed in such a way that my "
"research project can continue."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:264
msgid ""
"If you get rid of the maintenance bots on the second underground level of "
"this station, I will find the time to teach you something."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:268
msgid "Sorry, there is no human alive that could give you further training."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:272
msgid "I can teach you everything, for a price of course."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:273
msgid "Three hundred per lesson, up front."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:274
msgid "You will need %d training points."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:275
msgid "Still interested?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:288
msgid ""
"Good. The most important thing about hacking is to understand the nature of "
"the machine you want to hack."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:289
msgid ""
"Once you have figured out what the creators of the system were thinking when "
"setting it up, you'll also know how to best hack it."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:290
msgid ""
"Now I see the feature set of your hacking program has already improved a lot."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:306
msgid "Hold on, I don't seem to have that much money right now."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:308
msgid "Ok, come back when you can afford to pay me if you are interested."

"You Linarians are funny creatures. Come back later when you feel ready if "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:337
msgid "Strange, I should have a look at it..."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:338
msgid "...when I have more time.."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:348
msgid "Please, don't touch it."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:349
msgid "I don't want you to break it somehow."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:352
msgid "You better not touch it!"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:353
msgid "If you break it somehow, I'll be very angry."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:354
msgid "And I still have no time."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:355
msgid "The power level is still very low, hence, I am quite busy."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:366
msgid "You could just go around and enter by the main door."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:367
msgid "This way, you might waste time. You've optimized your path. Good job!"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:368
msgid "Thank you for your report, but I don't have time to fix it."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:377
msgid "You are really careful with the security of your mission."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:378
msgid "However don't destroy my equipment, I can support you to be stealthy."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:379
msgid "But later, maybe... I don't have time now."

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:388
msgid ""
"Oh, you have just entered by curiosity. I always fought for made it a "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:389
msgid ""
"I like curiosity. I think it will has rocketed us on Mars. And beyond..."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:390
msgid "Thank you, I now know the issue, but I don't have time to fix it."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:413
msgid "Hey Linarian..."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:414
msgid "Mmmh, yes?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:415
msgid "Do you know this feeling..."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:416
msgid "...when you get a really strange output..."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:417
msgid "... and you look at the code..."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:418
msgid "... again and again..."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:419
msgid "... but you see no path it could come from?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:420
msgid "Hmm, yes, I get this sometimes..."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:421
msgid ""
"I checked online if there is a name for this symptom... but couldn't find "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:422
msgid "I guess I am going to call it 'stdoubt'."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Kevin.lua:423
msgid "Ok..."
