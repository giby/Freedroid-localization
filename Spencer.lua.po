"Helping Bender along was also a smart move. But you should be very careful "

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:230
msgid "As far as I know, Bender is still very sick."

"OK. Your list of achievements is long enough. You can join us. So I hereby "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:268

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:269
msgid "Why's that?"

"We had a little disagreement, Francis and I. He refused to accept our rule "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:317
msgid "Hm, I still don't have the data cube."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:319
msgid "... What?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:320
msgid "Then you better go and look for it. Don't waste my time, Linarian."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:332
msgid "I think I lost the data cube."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:333
msgid "Come on, you've got to be kidding! ..."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:334
msgid ""
"So I will call one minion for this job. You are very useless, unable to "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:335
msgid "Get out of my sight!"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:347
msgid ""
"No, nothing so violent. Let's just say I know more about Francis than he "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:348
msgid ""
"Francis is someone who is very understandable. I just had to find the right "

msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:349
msgid "Anyway, we have nearly been close friends since."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:358
msgid ""
"We had an unfortunate misunderstanding, so we had a very hard time talking "
"together."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:359
msgid ""
"I wanted him to go through the people in cryonic freezing in the facility, "
"and make a list of disposable ones and people unlikely to survive. This cube "
"contains that list."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:360
msgid ""
"Disposable people? Unlikely to survive? Can't they just stay in cryonics "
"indefinitely?"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:361
msgid ""
"No. They take up a lot of space, and keeping them alive takes a lot of "
"power, which is running out. Most of the people there are sick or dying "
"anyway, which is why they're frozen in the first place. We can't afford to "
"waste any resources."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:362
msgid ""
"We even had to confiscate the town cook's macrowave oven battery, which "
"means we can't eat warm food anymore. We needed it to keep the town's "
"defenses up."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:371
msgid ""
"Well, I'm listening to you. But you must be quickly, I've no time to loose."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:372
msgid "If you found the data cube, just give it."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:386
msgid ""
"Yes, that's right, and in fact it might be crucial. As you may have heard, "
"the MS office is defended by a disruptor shield. They open it only to let "
"out new armies of bots."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:387
msgid ""
"The data on the cube he obtained indicates the existence of a secret "
"experimental facility in this region. Our findings suggest that they were "
"testing some new form of disruptor shield for MS, so the shield can be "
"controlled from that facility."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:388
msgid ""
"If the information is true, then you can take over the control droid and "
"disable the shield permanently so we can get in."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:389
msgid ""
"We know that MS had a firmware update system, which could be used to "
"propagate a malicious update to disable all bots. It is very alluring, but "
"to perform this trick you need to hack the control droid, which is in the "
"heart of the HF. To enter HF you would have to disable the disruptor shield."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:390
msgid ""
"This seems like a gift sent from the heavens. Cleaning the Hell Fortress is "
"not going to be easy, though.."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:398
msgid ""
"That's most kind of you to volunteer. So far, I've sent two scouts into the "
"area. They have found the facility entrance and unlocked the gate."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:399
msgid ""
"That is a good sign, because it shows that the key combinations from the "
"data cube were correct."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:400
msgid ""
"However, we lost contact with them shortly after they went inside. They also "
"reported heavy bot resistance."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:401
msgid ""
"I'd be glad if you could take a look. But use the utmost care. We can't "
"afford to lose another guard."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:409
msgid ""
"Good. The base entrance is somewhat hidden in the caves to the northeast. "
"Best to use the north gate out of town, then head east, and turn north again "
"along the shore."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:410
msgid ""
"I wish you the best of luck for this operation. It might be that our "
"survival depends on it. Don't wait for assistance."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:411
msgid ""
"Try to get control over the disruptor shield if you can. The control droid "
"should be somewhere on the lowest level of the installation. Simply "
"destroying the droid might suffice in disabling the shield."
msgstr ""

msgid "Opening access to MS Office"
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:421
msgid "Good. You should be well prepared if you intend to go."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:422
msgid ""
"Also there is no need to hurry with this. After all, the installation is not "
"running away, so it's best to take a cautious approach."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:430
msgid ""
"Good. We cannot help you much in this final mission, but I can tell you what "
"our recon teams gathered behind the factory doors. You will enter a zone "
"that used to be a MS office."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:431
msgid ""
"They carried out some development there, and had part of their patching "
"division and update management department. The actual factory is located "
"behind the office."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:432
msgid ""
"With a bit of luck, you might not need to access it. We know they have their "
"update server in the office."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:433
msgid ""
"If you can find it and get it to propagate a faulty update, this could "
"suffice to stopping bots dead in their tracks."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:434
msgid ""
"Look for the entrance of the office in the crystal fields. I will send a "
"message to the guards so they let you pass. Then you will be on your own."
msgstr ""

#: dialogs/Spencer.lua:435
msgid ""
"However I'll ask Richard to see if we can contact you as soon as you find "

"stasis sleep..."
